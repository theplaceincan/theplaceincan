## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

I've largely done web development (Vue); building websites for businesses, organizations, and personal projects. 
I'm also interested in low-level software (thanks to my Assembly class).

Languages & frameworks I'm familiar with:
- High-level languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, C++, Lua
- Low-level languages: MIPS, x86-64 w/ Ubuntu
- Frontend Frameworks: Vue.js
- CSS Frameworks: Vuetify, Tailwind CSS
